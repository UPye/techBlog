## Overview
Finally, a positive environment where coders can vent. It is a new and established tech blog. Here you can collaborate with developer like yourself to pass on knowledge and/or to just have a conversation with someone who ACTUALLY understands what you mean! 

## Installation
You will need to install dotenv, express, sequelize, mysql2, bcrypt, connect-session-sequelize, express-handlebars, express-session, handlebars and node (if not already downloaded). Install these packages to run and contribute to this app.

## Future Developments
I would love to expand on this e-commerce server built, so that more product information may be included to expand on the ever growing e-commerce market. I would also love to include front-end code, so it may become a community of entreprenuers supporting one another's growth. Lastly, I would like to deploy this application to Heroku.

## Credits
I want to thank UCF coding bootcamp for the knowledge gained this week to construct this database. It was very well put together and easy to understand!
